## General Information

I wanted to apply my knowledge of jQuery into creating a simple app that uses style methods for user interaction.
Font Preview lets the user test text displays for various font sizes, weights and types. 
It allows the user to:
- Input desired font-size in the text box, 
- Select desired font-weight from the dropdown menu,
- Select desired font-family from the dropdown menu.


## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery
